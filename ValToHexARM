@ ARM assembly language program that 
@ converts a 32 bit unsigned value stored in r1
@ to it's hexadecimal ASCII string representation.
@ Resulting string stored beginning at address 
@ 0xA1000400. 
@ Answer should contain 8 characters
@ with leading zeros where appropriate, and
@ should use uppercase 'A'-'F'.
